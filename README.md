# React Shopping Card Simulator

This is a Basic and Virtual Project developed by me where i am using React JS to simulate a shopping card using redux and global state as a practice and implementing components developed by me

I used basic technologies as:
* ```html (jsx)```
* ```CSS (sass)```
* ```JS (ES6)```
* ```edgrid CSS library```
